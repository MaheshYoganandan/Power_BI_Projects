# AdventureWorks Sales Dashboard
## Portfolio Project

This project was completed with the help of Maven Analytics' Power BI course, which provided valuable guidance and insights into the world of Power BI. I'm excited to share this project as part of my portfolio, demonstrating my skills in sales data analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation using Power BI.
